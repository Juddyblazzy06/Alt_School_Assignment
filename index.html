            I am a certified Teacher and author and currently an Altschooler. I
            joined Altschool to acquire expertise in the field of technology and
            computer programming because they train learners to unlock a wide
            range of career opportunities, from developing innovative software
            solutions to designing and implementing cutting-edge hardware
            systems. Moreover, understanding the fundamentals of technology
            engineering and programming will enable me to solve complex
            problems, think critically, and creatively, and adapt to new
            technologies, making me highly valued in the modern workforce.
            <br />I love playing video games and surfing the internet
